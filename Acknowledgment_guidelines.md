# Acknowledging KBase support

The following guidelines should be considered when producing materials about other work that may have used KBase resources.  This includes peer-reviewed publications submitted to journals, conference presentations (peer-reviewed or not), websites, etc. When in doubt, please contact [FIXME: who?] for further guidance.

The following general guidelines should be considered:

1. If you are planning a publication that acknowledges KBase funding (not just help or collaboration) please inform project leadership of the topic, the resources being spent, and the proposed author list. 

2. When the paper enters the writing stage reflect on what unpublished work from other's on the project you are using and if they need to be authors or acknowledged. 

3. If you believe there is possible authorship or ambiguity raise the issue eafrly. If other authors are to be brought onboard ensure they have a chance to read and edit the manuscript. 

4. If significant project resources and/or concepts have been used then it is likely the PIs should be included. 

5. The contribution should have forwarded known milestones for KBase and be reflected in its public face for program managers and others to see. 

6. Using KBase as part of your own scientific research does not require KBase funding acknowledgement. 


The following classes of outputs should always cite KBase:

1. Papers about the system, it's goals, design, performance, usage etc.  Should cite kbase support 

2. Papers that are about new tools or technologies that get encorporated into kbase where a kbase supported person was involved in that tool creation.  Should cite kbase support if that supper was material to the method or tool 

3. Papers that use kbase. Should cite the main kbase paper. But if the use was by a kbase supported person it should also cite kbase support.

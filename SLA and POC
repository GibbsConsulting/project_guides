Service Level Agreement (SLA) for KBase

For issues in production or other deployment environments, the designated Point of Contact (POC)
is the primary contact for reporting problems.  Internal developers can use the appropriate Slack channel
(either sysadmin, poc, or some other channel) to report problems.

Our normal operating hours are 9am to 8pm Eastern time (7am-6pm Central, 6am-5pm Pacific), Monday
through Friday (except holidays).  During these hours the POC will respond to issues within N hours.
Outside of these hours, the POC will respond as soon as possible the next business day.  For catastrophic
issues that occur outside our normal SLA, the POC will respond as soon as possible.  (Catastrophic issues
are those which cause most or all of KBase to be completely unusable with no possible workaround.  Examples
include a core service such as workspace or Shock going down.)

We will post a POC rotation to [somewhere].  If the assigned POC is unavailable for a short time during
his or her posted rotation, he must ask in [the appropriate channel] for someone to cover those hours.

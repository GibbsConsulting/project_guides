# Service Level Agreement (SLA) for KBase

For issues in production or other deployment environments, the designated Point of Contact (POC)
is the primary contact for reporting problems.  Internal developers should use the #poc Slack channel
to report problems.

Our normal operating hours are 9am to 8pm Eastern time (7am-6pm Central, 6am-5pm Pacific), Monday
through Friday (except holidays).  During these hours, the POC will respond to (not necessarily resolve)
issues within 2 hours.  Outside of these hours, the POC will respond as soon as possible the next business
day.  For catastrophic issues that occur outside our normal SLA, the POC will respond as soon as possible.  
(Catastrophic issues are those which cause most or all of KBase to be completely unusable with no possible
workaround.  Examples include a core service such as workspace or Shock going down.)

We will post a POC rotation to the #poc channel.  If the assigned POC is unavailable for a short time during
his or her posted rotation, he must ask in #poc for someone to cover those hours.

The POC will not be assigned a sprint team or other duties during his or her rotation.  The primary duty
of the POC will be to respond to reported issues, refer them to other devops team members as needed,
and follow up with the reporter to verify a resolution.  Secondary duties may include doing nonintrusive
maintenance on KBase systems.

Devops members who are not the POC will normally be assigned to a sprint team, and will not be
expected to respond to POC issues unless specifically requested by the POC.

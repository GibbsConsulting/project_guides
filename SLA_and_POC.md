# Service Level Agreement (SLA) for KBase

Our normal operating hours are 8am to 7pm Eastern time (7am-6pm Central, 6am-5pm Pacific), Monday through Friday (except holidays).  During these hours, the POC will respond to (not necessarily resolve) production issues within 2 hours.  Outside of these hours, the POC will respond as soon as possible the next business day.  For catastrophic issues that occur outside our normal SLA, the POC will respond as soon as possible.  (Catastrophic issues are those which cause most or all of KBase to be completely unusable with no possible workaround.  Examples include a core service such as workspace or Shock going down.)  Production issues will be routed by the help desk coordinator, internal developers, and the monitoring center to the appropriate venue.

Issues in non-production environments should be reported in the Slack #poc channel.  These issues will be routed to the most appropriate resource by the POC within one business day.

The POC rotation will be managed in pagerduty, GCal, or Slack (still TBD).

The primary duties of the POC will be to respond to reported issues, and either resolve them, refer them to other team members, or refer the reporter to the product team's bug triage process, as needed.  Secondary duties will include doing maintenance on KBase systems and responding to implementation team requests (if other devops staff are not available).

Devops members who are not the POC should focus on tasks for implementation team.  They will not be expected to respond to POC issues unless one is routed to them by the POC.

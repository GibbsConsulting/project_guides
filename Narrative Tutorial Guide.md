## Narrative Tutorial Process

### Process for Creating Tutorials for Apps/Workflows
1) First draft of tutorials should be written by Product Owners in a Narrative after beta testing and before user testing - draft Introduction, Overview, step by step instructions (Product Owners, developers with UE input)
2) Editors (UE) test steps in tutorial, transfer Narrative tutorial text to Google Doc, revise Narrative tutorial text for clarity, and provide questions/feedback to and get answers/input from product owners, then further revise as necessary.
3) Product owners review edits to Narrative text and accept/reject them. If edits are rejected, product owners need to provide explanation or justification. A teleconference should be scheduled to discuss issues if needed.
4) Product owners grant the “kbasedocumentation” account write access to Narrative tutorial so that edits can be transferred and the UE team can make future updates as needed.
5) UE (as “kbasedocumentation”) transfers revised text into Narrative tutorial. After this, the google doc is marked OBSOLETE, and any further edits are done in the Narrative itself.
6) Narrative Tutorial is submitted to external communications approval process before new app and tutorial are released publicly.
7) Narrative Tutorial made public and linked to from Narrative Library on KBase.us with blog post and social media to promote tutorial. UE and Product Owners continue to have editing privileges.

### Continued management of Narrative Tutorials
1) Product owners will communicate with UE about app updates that require changes to the Narrative tutorial and UE will update the tutorial. 
2) Product owners and UE will communicate with each other about any changes to a Narrative tutorial. During any period of updating a Narrative tutorial, any person making changes will inform product owners and UE when they have started and finished making updates to ensure against simultaneous destructive editing.
3) UE will make backup copies of each Narrative tutorial to ensure there is a saved record in case simultaneous destructive editing of a Narrative occurs.

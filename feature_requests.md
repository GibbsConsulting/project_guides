##UI/UX features

###Visualization of metabolic models and pathway flux on metabolic maps

**Priority**
Very high

**Estimated hours required**
80-120

**Description**
Modify the existing model and FBA landing pages/narrative viewers to display model and flux
data on a metabolic map. Ideally metabolic map should be flexible and loaded from a wide 
range of potential resources (KEGG, Reactome, PMN, custom user maps). Widget should be
flexible so the same map can be used to paint omics data etc.

###Gapfilling of all conditions in a phenotype set

**Priority**
Medium

**Estimated hours required**
40-80

**Description**
Gapfill all conditions in an input phenotype set and display the number of gapfilled reactions
required for each phenotype condition. Also support reconciliation of models with phenotype
data.

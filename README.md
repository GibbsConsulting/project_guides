# KBase Process Documents

This repo contains a set of documents that will hopefully become a complete
guide for the KBase development process, from the writing and merging of code
to data, deployment, operations and more.

**Note:** the KBase Trac wiki has lots of information related to these same topics, though it's not publicly available.  Folks should feel free to pull from there whatever is relevant and contribute it here, so we can have a single, publicly visible location for these docs.

In their current form, the documents in this repo are still very much in early-draft stages, meant to
be discussed and refined.

For this repository, the two main way to discuss changes/questions about the
contents are:

1. For a generic question/comment, open an issue on the repo, pointing to the
   file/line number in question. This can be used to discuss a topic until a
   solution is found.

1. To make a concrete proposal for change,
   [open a pull request (PR)](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
   with the proposed changes. Note that since this repository doesn't contain
   any code, only markdown files, it's very easy to do the editing and PR
   process directly inside the browser, by using the "edit this file" button.
   This can include either changes to existing docs, or proposing new documents
   that should be in this repo.

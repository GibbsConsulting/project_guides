# User testing

User testing, also called "usability testing", is where one user at a time is shown something (e.g. a web site, or API) and asked to either (a) figure out what it is, or (b) try to do a typical task. That sentence is stolen directly from this excellent chapter on how to do lightweight user testing:

[Don't Make me Think, Chapter 9: Usability testing on 10 cents a day](http://sensible.com/downloads/DMMTchapter09_for_personal_use_only.pdfÎ©)

The purpose of this document is, first, to get everyone to read this chapter (like, right now; it's only about a dozen pages!), and second, to provide a landing page for details of the process of user testing as it relates to the development and deployment of new functionality in KBase

## Organization

Although responsibility for participating in user testing is the responsibility of any team developing a UI component, the User Engagement team will be responsible for leading the process, including communication of the results to the whole group.

## When to do user testing

Early and often. But more specifics should be placed here of when in the development process we would like to see some user tests.

## Summary

User testing is an important tool for the rapid development of a highly usable system. However, it does not occur naturally in the development process and must be consciously planned for and implemented. The User Engagement team will be responsible for directing this process, and serve as the focal point for knowledge about how to effectively do tests.

**External Communications Approval Process**

1.  Team member drafts content for release (this includes posters, presentations, manuscripts, and anything that will be released publicly that is about KBase or referring to KBase in a significant way [for example, showing analyses that were performed in KBase]).
2.  Lead author of content send it to the External Communications Approval team: communications-approval@kbase.us or pr-approval@kbase.us.
3.  Within two days, the External Communications Approval team will either suggest edits or approve it. 
4.  If edits are suggested, the original author will review the suggested edits, incorporate them as appropriate, reply back to PR-approval with the edited document attached, and comment on what was changed.
5.  Two or more people from the External Communications Approval team need to indicate their approval before the content can be released publicly.
6.  If only one approval is received in 48 hours following submission to communications-approval@kbase.us, and the content is not anything controversial or sensitive, the single approval is fine and author can release their content. The author will reply to the approval email and to the PR-approval list, and indicate they are now releasing the content.
